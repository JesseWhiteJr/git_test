        <h1>Dogs</h1>
        <p>Dogs are considered to be man's best friend. While some dogs 
            are <em>family oriented,</em> there are some that are considered
            <strong>vicious and very aggressive</strong>. My favorite dog 
            breeds are shiba inu, husky, beagle, german shepherd and golden
            retriever.</p>

        <h1>Cats</h1>
        <p>Cats are the direct opposit from dogs. They are <strong>NOT</strong> 
           to be man's best friend. While some cats are friendly, most can be
           <em>very</em> temperamental and moody. But generally, they are good
           house pets. I <strong>DO NOT</strong> have a favorite breed, as they are
           not my preference for a pet.</p>
